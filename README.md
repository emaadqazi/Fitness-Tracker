## **About**
I built this project in my second year of university to further develop my programming skills while combining my passion for fitness. During my high school co-op at Apple in 2021, I created a similar fitness app using Xcode and Swift. Since then, I have gained significant experience and wanted to challenge myself by building a full-stack application from scratch. In the future, I hope to revisit this project and deploy a mobile version to the App Store.

While this is a full-stack, web-based application, my primary focus was on backend development and data management. I integrated Supabase as the backend service, enabling secure cloud-based storage for both user data and media uploads. This structure ensures that all content is efficiently organized and scalable for future enhancements.

## ⚡ Technologies Used

- **SQLAlchemy** (ORM for Database Interactions)
- **Bootstrap 5** (Frontend Styling)
- **Jinja2** (HTML Templating Engine)
- **Chart.js** (Data Visualization)
- **Render** (Deployment Platform)
